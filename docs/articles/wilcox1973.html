      <h1>Indices of Qualitative variation</h1>

<div class="contents">
<p>In 1973, Wilcox published a paper presenting various indices of qualitative variation for social scientists. The problem is to find relevant statistical indices to measure the variation in nominal-scale (i.e. qualitative or categorical) data. Please see the Wilcox paper for more details on the rationale.</p>
<p>Wilcox presents six indices that can be used to measure qualitative variation. The <code>qualvar</code> package implements these indices so that R users can easily use them.</p>
<div id="the-indices" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#the-indices" class="anchor"></a>The indices</h1>
<div id="the-dm-deviation-from-the-mode" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#the-dm-deviation-from-the-mode" class="anchor"></a>The DM (deviation from the mode)</h2>
<p>According to Wilcox (1973, p. 327), ‘the measure can be thought of as an index of deviation from the modal frequency, analogous to the variance as a measure of deviation from the mean’. The formula for the DM is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 1 - \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^k (f_m - f_i)}{N(K-1)} \]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="the-ada-average-deviation-analog" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#the-ada-average-deviation-analog" class="anchor"></a>The ADA (average deviation analog)</h2>
<p>According to Wilcox (1973, p. 328), the ADA is ‘an analog of the average or mean deviation’. The formula for the ADA is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k \left| f_i - \frac{N}{K}\right|}{2 \frac{N}{K}(K-1)} \]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="the-mda-or-mndif-mean-difference-analog" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#the-mda-or-mndif-mean-difference-analog" class="anchor"></a>The MDA (or MNDIF – mean difference analog)</h2>
<p>According to Wilcox (1973, p. 328), the MDA is ‘an analog of the mean difference, a measure of variation that is discussed and used much less frequently than the average deviation or the standard deviation. It is defined as “the average of the differences of all the possible pairs of variate-values, taken regardless of sign”’. The formula for the MDA is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^k |f_i - f_j|}{N(K-1)} \]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="the-va-variance-analog" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#the-va-variance-analog" class="anchor"></a>The VA (variance analog)</h2>
<p>According to Wilcox (1973, p. 329), the VA is ‘based on the variance, which is defined as the arithmetic mean of the squared differences of each value from the mean’. The formula for the VA is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k \left(f_i - \frac{N}{K}\right)^2}{\frac{N^2(K-1)}{K}} \]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="the-hrel-index" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#the-hrel-index" class="anchor"></a>The HREL index</h2>
<p>According to Wilcox (1973, p. 329), and following Senders (1958), the HREL is ’a measure originally developed by engineers for use in specifying the properties of communications channels. The rationale for HREL is presented in terms of guessing by Virginia Senders (supplementing the mode as best guess): “What we need is a measure of uncertainty, or of ‘poorness of a guess,’ which will be high when the number of alternative possibilities is high, and low when some ofthe possibilities are much more likely than others. One possible measure is the average number of questions we have to ask to specify the correct alternative’. The formula for the HREL is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{f_i}{N} \log_2 \frac{f_i}{N}}{\log_2 K} \]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="the-b-index" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#the-b-index" class="anchor"></a>The B index</h2>
<p>According to Wilcox (1973, p. 330), and following Kaiser (1968), the B index relies on the geometric mean, but corrects it for undesirable properties. The formula for the B index is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 1 - \sqrt{1 - \left(\sqrt[K]{\prod_{i=1}^k \frac{f_i K}{N}}\right)^2} \]</span></p>

<a href="#usage-of-the-functions-provided-by-this-package" class="anchor"></a>Usage of the functions provided by this package</h1>
<p>The functions provided in this package are very easy to use: they take as their only argument a vector of frequencies. For example, the deviation from the mode (DM) function can be used this way:</p>
